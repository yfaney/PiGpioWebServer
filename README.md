This is also used for turning on/off a power switch using a switch relay.

This project follows the original license where it comes from.

In addition, I used some existing code for building a GPIO Web Server but I cannot find where I downloaded it.
Please let me know if anyone knows where it was, who originally built it.

You can download it, modify it, redistribute it, but <b>just remember that someone has worked hard</b>. :)
